Download the Chirpy Theme FilesYou can download the zip file from a site that collects themes, or fork it from the official Chirpy repository, but I chose to clone it.  Chirpy RepositoryAfter cloning, copy all the contents from the jekyll-theme-chirpy folder to your local repository (…/(your GitHub username).github.io). When prompted to overwrite, select Yes.2. Install Ruby and JekyllRuby  Ruby Installer Download LinkDownload and run the installer, then keep clicking next until the installation is complete.When this screen appears, press 3 and Enter to finish the installation.JekyllNow, you’ll find Start Command Prompt with Ruby in the start menu. Run it and in your local GitHub blog repository, enter:gem install jekyllgem install bundlerto install Jekyll and Bundler. Just to be sure, check if the installation was successful with:ruby -vjekyll -vbundler -vIf you see something like this, it means the installation was successful (note that versions may vary depending on the time of installation).3. Install Node.js and npm  Node.js DownloadDownload and install Node.js, then in the Command Prompt, run:npm install &amp;&amp; npm run buildThis prevents complaints about missing *.min.js files when building with Jekyll.4. Install the Chirpy ThemeDelete the doc folder in your local blog folder. You can also delete the contents of the _posts folder, but you can leave them to check if everything works correctly after local or GitHub deployment.In the .github/workflows folder of your local blog, delete everything except the file named pages-deploy.yml.hook, and remove the .hook extension to turn it into a .yml file.Then run:bundleto install the theme.5. Check LocallyEnter:bundle exec jekyll serve --liveReloadand type localhost:4000 in any browser to see how your blog will look when deployed. The --liveReload option automatically reflects any changes made to the page files in the blog view.6. Set Up GitHub ActionIf the blog displays correctly, it’s time to upload it to GitHub. However, the Chirpy theme requires automatic build and deployment via GitHub Actions, so let’s set that up first.Go to Settings in your blog’s GitHub repository, then to Pages in the left tab, and under Source, change Deploy from a branch to GitHub Actions.After clicking Configure in the box that appears, you don’t need to change anything else. Just click Commit changes… in the top right corner to finish the deployment setup.7. Push for Automatic Build and DeploymentSince GitHub Action was added, new files have been added to the remote .github folder, so first run:git pull origin mainThen:git add *git commit -m \"git blog init\"git push origin mainto push. You can then see the build and deployment happening in the Actions tab of your remote repository. If you see a green light, check your blog at your address (username.github.io) to see if it’s visible online.If you see a red light or the blog isn’t working properly even with a green light, refer to the upcoming post on error cases for solutions.8.

    "content": "IntroductionIn the past few days, I’ve created a blog on GitHub Pages. Initially, I considered using Tistory or Google Blogspot for my blog, but I was captivated by the strange idea of wanting to support multiple languages, which led me to GitHub Pages.Tistory/Blogspot does have multilingual support plugins, but they are either of low quality, difficult to modify translations, or paid, which I didn’t like.There were times during the process when I encountered errors with no information available for resolution, and I thought about just using Tistory. However, I persevered and finally succeeded by persistently consulting GPT. I proceeded in the following steps, and since I used the Chirpy theme, this might not be helpful for those using other themes.Series Post Links(1) Create a Repository and Check the Test Page(2) [Applying the Chirpy Theme](https://hionpu.com/posts/Github_blog_2)(3) How to Upload Posts(4) Make the blog supports multiple languages(5) Creating a Sitemap1.
