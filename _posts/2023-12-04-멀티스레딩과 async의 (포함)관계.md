Then using task and async/await(TAP) is kind of multithreading? I want to know the relationship like one is subset of another.

Understanding the relationship between tasks, async/await (Task-based Asynchronous Pattern, or TAP), and multithreading can be a bit complex, as they intersect but also have distinct purposes. Here's a breakdown to help clarify their relationship:

### Tasks and Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)

1. **Tasks (`Task` and `Task<T>`):** In .NET, a `Task` represents an asynchronous operation. It could be either I/O-bound (like a network request) or CPU-bound (like a computation-intensive operation). A `Task` does not necessarily correspond to a new thread. Instead, it represents a unit of work that will be completed at some point in the future.
    
2. **Async/Await:** This is a syntax introduced in C# to make it easier to write and read asynchronous code. The `async` keyword is used to mark a method as asynchronous, and `await` is used to mark the suspension point in the method, indicating that the method's execution can continue when the awaited Task is completed. The async/await pattern simplifies the process of working with Tasks, especially when it comes to chaining asynchronous operations and handling exceptions.
    

### Multithreading

1. **Multithreading:** This refers to the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently. In the context of .NET, it generally involves the `System.Threading` namespace. Multithreading is a way to achieve parallelism, where multiple threads are executing code at the same time.
    
2. **Relationship to Tasks:** A Task may or may not use a new thread. For example, an I/O-bound Task (like reading a file or awaiting a web request) does not need to occupy a thread while it waits for the I/O operation to complete. On the other hand, a CPU-bound Task, if run on a thread pool thread (for example, via `Task.Run`), does involve multithreading.
    

### Understanding the Relationship

- **Subset:** You can think of async/await and Tasks (TAP) as a part of the broader concept of multithreading, but they are not synonymous. TAP is a higher-level abstraction that can leverage multithreading, but it can also accomplish asynchronous operations without creating new threads.
    
- **Purpose:** The primary goal of async/await and Tasks is to facilitate asynchronous programming, particularly for I/O-bound operations, without necessarily creating new threads. Multithreading, on the other hand, is explicitly about running code on multiple threads simultaneously.
    
- **Concurrency vs. Parallelism:** Async/await and Tasks often deal with concurrency (managing lots of things at once, like waiting for multiple web requests to return). Multithreading is a form of parallelism (doing lots of things at once), which is a subset of concurrency.
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - **Use async/await and Tasks when:**
        - You're dealing with I/O-bound operations.
        - You want to improve the responsiveness of your application.
        - You're performing CPU-bound operations and want to offload them to a background thread without manually managing threads.
    - **Use explicit multithreading when:**
        - You need fine-grained control over threads.
        - You're implementing parallel algorithms that benefit from running simultaneously on multiple threads.

In summary, TAP (async/await and Tasks) is a high-level abstraction that can utilize multithreading but is primarily focused on asynchronous programming. Multithreading is a lower-level concept that's explicitly about running multiple threads concurrently and is one of the ways to achieve parallelism in your applications.
